## Question 1 (14 points)
**Cache EMAT and CPI**

Sanskriti's pipelined processor features separate instruction and data caches.
The instruction cache (I-cache) has a **single** level and the data cache
(D-cache) has **three** levels, as shown in the following diagram.

|                 | I-Cache L1 | D-Cache L1 | D-Cache L2 | D-Cache L3 |
|-----------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Hit Ratio**   | 97%        | 88%        | 75%        | 72%        |
| **Access Time** | 4 cycles   | 4 cycles   | 14 cycles  | 24 cycles  |
| **Block Size**  | 1 word     | 1 word     | 1 word     | 1 word         |

You may assume the following information about this processor and its caches:

* The architecture is word-addressable, and all loads and stores operate on one
  word.
* The processor achieves an average CPI of 1.2, without accounting for memory
  stalls.
* Memory accesses (LWs and SWs) account for 25% of all the instructions
  executed.
* Out of these memory accesses, 65% are reads and 35% are writes.
* On a cache miss, the CPU experiences a latency of 120 cycles to read from
  memory
* There is a latency of 7 cycles to write to memory.
* All caches use the write-through and write-allocate policies.
* There is no write-buffer in the datapath between the CPU and memory bus, hence
  the CPU must stall until each write reaches memory.

For each of the following questions (1.1 to 1.9), show your work to receive
credit. Round your final answers to **2 decimal places**. For EMAT
calculations, give your answer in terms of **CPU cycles**.
