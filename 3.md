## Question 3 (4 points)
**Memory Pressure**

Kaylia notices the following virtual page accesses are recorded for three
independent processes P1, P2, and P3 respectively over a time interval.

P1: 0, 1, 0, 21, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0  
P2: 91, 62, 1, 65, 55, 55, 62, 1, 91, 91, 62  
P3: 45, 10, 3, 3, 5, 7, 28, 5

What is the **cumulative memory pressure** on the system during this time
interval?  
P1: {0, 1, 21, 4}  
P2: {91, 62, 1, 65, 55}  
P3: {45, 10, 3, 5, 7, 28}  
**Total**: 15
