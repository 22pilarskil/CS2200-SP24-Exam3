## Question 4 (12 points)
**Cache Miss Types**

### Q4.1 (6 points)
Consider a direct-mapped cache with **5 sets**. Sets are indexed from 0 to 4. The
cache block size is a **word**. Assume that the cache is initially empty and that
each memory access operates at word granularity (i.e., all addresses are word
addresses).

a) For the memory accesses shown below starting from an empty cache, fill in
the rows. If there is a miss, please specify the type of miss in the table.

### Q4.2 (6 points)
Now, consider a **3-way** set associative cache with 3 sets. The cache uses an
LRU replacement policy. Sets are indexed from 0 to 2 and ways are numbered from
0 to 2. The cache block size is a word. Assume that the cache is initially
empty and that each memory access operates at word granularity (i.e., all
addresses are word addresses). If the cache set is empty, use cache way 0.

c) For the memory accesses shown below starting from an empty cache, fill in
the rows. If there is a miss, please specify the type of miss in the table.
