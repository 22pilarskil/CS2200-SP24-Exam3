## Question 6 (11 points)
**Cache Calculations**

Prasad is an intern at Intel. His job is designing a 4-way set-associative
cache with the following characteristics:

* Total cache capacity = 128 KB (1KB = 1024 bytes).
* CPU uses 64-bit byte-addressable memory addresses.
* The cache block size is 64 bytes.
* The cache has one valid bit per cache block.
* The cache uses a write-back policy and uses one dirty bit per 8-byte word to
  minimize the amount of data that must be written back when an eviction
  occurs.
* The cache’s replacement policy guarantees that the two most-recently used
  cache blocks will not be evicted. The MRU fields uniquely identify the two
  most recently used cache blocks in that cache set. For replacement, one of
  the remaining 2 ways is chosen at random.
* MRU does not encode the entire history; it only keeps track of the indices
  of the two most recently accessed ways.

However, Prasad never took CS 2200 and is thus completely lost! Help him by
answering some questions to design the cache.

### Q6.1 (2 points)
How many sets are in the cache?

### Q6.2 (3 points)
How many bits are needed for the following (1 pt each):

a) Block Offset

b) Index

c) Tag

### Q6.3 (2 points)
How many dirty bits are needed per cache block?

### Q6.4 (2 points)
How many MRU bits are needed per set?

### Q6.5 (2 points)
How many bits are required in total for metadata storage (including MRU)? You
don’t need to compute the final sum.
