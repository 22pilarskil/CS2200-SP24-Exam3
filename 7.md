## Question 7 (9 points)
**Page Replacement**

Consider a paged memory system with **5 physical frames** that the OS has
reserved strictly for housing application pages.

Figure 1 shows a timeline of virtual page accesses with associated timestamps.
For example, at timestamp 2, virtual page 10 is accessed.

**Figure 1: Timeline of Page Accesses**
| Timestamp | Virtual Page Accessed |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 1         |  1                    |
| 2         | 10                    |
| 3         |  7                    |
| 4         |  3                    |
| 5         |  4                    |
| 6         |  5                    |
| 7         |  1                    |
| 8         |  8                    |
| 9         | 10                    |

The memory system has a hardware component in the CPU called the Tracker. The
Tracker records the access order of all the pages currently in memory. That is,
entry 1 holds the most recently accessed page, entry 2 holds the second most
recently accessed page, and the last entry holds the least recently accessed
page.

Figure 2 shows the contents of the Tracker at timestamp 5. Its contents are
[4, 3, 7, 10, 1]. The first entry in the Tracker is the most recently accessed
page: page 4. The Tracker is accessible to the memory management system in the
OS. There cannot be duplicate entries in the tracker.

**Figure 2: Contents of the Tracker at timestamp 5**
| Entry 1 | Entry 2 | Entry 3 | Entry 4 | Entry 5 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 4       | 3       | 7       | 10      | 1       |

### Q7.1 (2 points)
Explain how the operating system can use the Tracker component to make page
replacement decisions.

### Q7.2 (2 points)
What are the contents of the Tracker at timestamp 9?

### Q7.3 (3 points)
How many total page faults occur in total in this scenario of 9 page accesses.
Assume that none of the pages are in physical memory in the beginning. Show
your work for credit.

### Q7.4 (2 points)
Would implementing a Tracker component be feasible for a memory system with
thousands of physical frames? Explain why or why not.
