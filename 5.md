## Question 5 (10 points)
**Cache Design**

The CS 2200 TA team is tasked with designing a 4KB (1KB = 1024 bytes) cache.
(Note: Only descriptive answers are expected for this question)

### Q5.1 (3 points)
Nityam decides to design the cache with 256 sets and 16B cache blocks. What are
some drawbacks of his design?

This is a direct mapped cache. A drawback is that each address only corresponds
to one spot in the cache. As a result, it can be an inefficient use of space,
since there’s no flexibility to place addresses in free locations.

### Q5.2 (3 points)
Ayush decides to design the cache with 256 ways and 16B cache blocks. What is
another name for Ayush’s cache design? Why might it not perform as well as
Nityam’s design?

This is a fully associative cache. The downside is that you need a lot of
additional hardware for the comparators.

Note that this does not significantly slow down lookups, since the lookup can
happen in parallel. It will consume more power.

### Q5.3 (4 points)
Kaylia designs a direct mapped cache, but with 256B cache blocks. What are some
of the advantages and disadvantages of this design compared to Nityam’s cache?

An advantage of this cache is that it exploits spatial locality very
effectively, for nearby memory addresses, the hit rate will be extremely high.
However the downside is that on a miss, the penalty is extremely high, since
you need to get a lot of values from memory. There’s also very few sets, so if
the program accesses several values from different parts of memory, we could
see a large slow down.
