## Question 2 (10 points)
**Paging and Page Size**

Consider a memory system with 24-bit virtual addresses, 20-bit physical memory
addresses, and a page size of 2048 B. Calculate the following for questions
2.1-2.4.

### Q2.1 (2 points)
Size of VPN in bits.  
13

### Q2.2 (2 points)
Size of PFN in bits.  
9

### Q2.3 (1 point)
Number of page table entries (answer should be in the format: **2ⁿ**).  
2^13

### Q2.4 (1 point)
Number of frame table entries (answer should be in the format: **2ⁿ**).  
2^9

### Q2.5 (2 points)
A standard page size for virtual memory is 4 KB, but some systems support page
sizes of 2 MB or larger. How does the page size affect the frequency of page
faults in a virtual memory system? Explain your answer.  
A larger page size means that we take better advantage of spatial locality, since more nearby addresses will correspond to the same page. This will help to reduce page faults from nearby accesses in the same process. However, a larger page size means less total pages. If we have a lot of processes using a lot of pages, we will thrash sooner, which results in more page faults.

### Q2.6 (2 points)
How does the page size affect internal fragmentation? Explain your answer.  
A larger page size means more internal fragmentation, since there is more total space so more of it is unused.
